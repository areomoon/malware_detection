# Malware Detection

## Problem Statement
The detection of malicious software (malware) is an important problem in cyber security, especially as more of society becomes dependent on computing systems.  

In the past few years, the malware industry has grown very rapidly that, the syndicates invest heavily in technologies to evade traditional protection, forcing the anti-malware groups/communities to build more robust softwares to detect and terminate these attacks. The major part of protecting a computer system from a malware attack is to identify whether a given piece of file/software is a malware.

## Source
Microsoft has been very active in building anti-malware products over the years and it runs itâ€™s anti-malware utilities over 150 million computers around the world. This generates tens of millions of daily data points to be analyzed as potential malware. In order to be effective in analyzing and classifying such large amounts of data, we need to be able to group them into groups and identify their respective families.
This dataset provided by Microsoft contains about 10 classes of malware.

## Model/Algorithm
This repository contains the source code for detecting different type of malwares using Deep learning based Feature Extraction and Wraper based Feature Selection Technique. A research paper describing how it works is availible at "to be updated"

Two major approaches we used for malware classification: 
- 1- **CNN-Base**   
  Image representation of .bytes file shows pattern for different malware classes. We apply pretrained VGG16 and self-defined CNN base model to extrat features from .bytes image for classifying the malware files.  
  
- 2- **TextCNN-Base**  
  Sequence representation of .bytes file contains significant information of malware. We implement the MalConv proposed in [Malware Detection by Eating a Whole EXE.](https://aaai.org/ocs/index.php/WS/AAAIW18/paper/download/16422/15577), but since the limitation of the time and computation resource we adjust the neuralnet structure of the original paper to take shorter sequence length as input (from 2000000 to 4096) and window size of dilated CNN. 


## Dependency
Please make sure each of them is installed with the correct version

- numpy (1.14.0)
- pytorch (0.4.0)
- sklearn (0.22.0)
- PIL

We used python 3.7 for this project.
